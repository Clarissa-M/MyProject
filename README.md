# Spend Alert: Responsible Innovation in online-gaming
*****
This project is my Master project at the University of Glasgow. The goal was to develop a PROTOTYPE for a mobile application to help gamers self-regulate their in-game purchases.
To try out the app on your computer the best way is to use Android Studio and an Android Emulator. 
This page will explain to you how to install Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/install
The emulator used during developement was a Pixel 3a API 30. 
The application data is stored on the mobile device that the app runs on. 
The current version uses simulated past spending data for an optimal overview of how the application works. 

The application offers the user the functionality to:
-set a spending limit in a defined time frame (day, week, month)
-be alerted once the limit has been passed
-have an overview over past spending on in-game purcheses
-seek help if needed
